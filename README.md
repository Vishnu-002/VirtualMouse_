# VirtualMouse
A virtual mouse is a project that allows a user to control the cursor on a computer screen using hand gestures or body movements, rather than a physical mouse.
It typically uses computer vision algorithms to track the movement of the user's hand or body, and then maps those movements to corresponding cursor movements on the screen.

## Title: Virtual Mouse

### Description:
The Virtual Mouse project is a real-time computer vision application that utilizes hand tracking to control the mouse cursor on the screen. Built with Python and OpenCV, it employs MediaPipe's Hand Tracking solution to detect hand landmarks from the webcam feed. By analyzing the movements of specific landmarks, such as the index finger and thumb, users can move the cursor and perform actions like clicking. This project offers an innovative and hands-free alternative to traditional mouse input methods, providing users with greater flexibility and accessibility in interacting with their computers.


### Key Features:
**1. Hand Gesture Detection:** The project employs the MediaPipe library to detect and track the user's hand movements in real-time from the video feed captured by the webcam.

**2. Cursor Movement:** By mapping the position of specific landmarks on the hand, such as the index finger and thumb, to the screen coordinates, the project enables users to move the cursor across the screen effortlessly.

**3. Click Actions:** Recognizing gestures, such as bringing the index finger close to the thumb, simulates a mouse click, allowing users to interact with on-screen elements without physical mouse input.

**4. Responsive and Intuitive Interface:** The virtual mouse interface provides smooth and responsive cursor control, enhancing user productivity and comfort during interaction sessions.

By eliminating the need for physical mouse hardware, the Virtual Mouse project offers a hands-free computing experience, making it particularly beneficial for individuals with mobility impairments or those seeking a futuristic and innovative input method. Whether for presentations, gaming, or everyday computing tasks, this project opens up new possibilities for human-computer interaction.
